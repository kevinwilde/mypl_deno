Implementing a programming language. The language includes a static type system with full type inference. The syntax is mostly based on racket. Heavily aided by [_Types and Programming Languages_ by Benjamin C. Pierce](https://books.google.com/books/about/Types_and_Programming_Languages.html?id=ti6zoAC9Ph8C).

In addition to TAPL, _Complete Type Inference for Simple Objects_ by Mitchell Wand (1987) was used as a resource. The type checker includes an implementation of the algorithm Wand described for inferring the types of records.
